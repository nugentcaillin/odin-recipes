			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add chopped onion and minced garlic, sauté until softened.</li>
				<li>Add the ground beef (or beef/pork mix) and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon.</li>
				<li>Stir in tomato paste, canned tomatoes, dried oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Add a splash of red wine if using.</li>
				<li>Simmer the sauce on low heat for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding a pinch of sugar if needed to balance acidity.</li>
				<li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and whisk continuously for 1-2 minutes to form a roux.</li>
				<li>Gradually pour in milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens.</li>
				<li>Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
				<li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce to prevent sticking.</li>
				<li>Add a layer of lasagne sheets, followed by meat sauce, béchamel, and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
				<li>Repeat the layers until the dish is full, finishing with a top layer of béchamel and a generous amount of cheese.</li>
				<li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
				<li>Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
				<li>Let the lasagne rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.</li>
