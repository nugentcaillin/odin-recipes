		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its rich and creamy texture. It traditionally consists of spaghetti, eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, guanciale (cured pork cheek), and black pepper. The eggs and cheese create a smooth sauce that coats the pasta, while the guanciale adds a savory, salty flavor.</p>
		<p>The key to a perfect carbonara lies in its simplicity and technique. The hot pasta is tossed with a mixture of beaten eggs and cheese, using the residual heat to cook the eggs gently without scrambling them. This creates a velvety sauce that clings to the pasta.</p>
		<p>Carbonara is believed to have originated in Rome, though its exact history is debated. It’s a comforting dish that highlights the quality of its few ingredients. When made well, it’s a harmonious blend of creamy, salty, and peppery flavors, making it a beloved favorite worldwide.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>400g (14 oz) spaghetti (or your preferred pasta)</li>
			<li>150g (5 oz) guanciale (or pancetta if unavailable), diced</li>
			<li>3 large eggs</li>
			<li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or Parmesan as a substitute)</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, peeled (optional)</li>
			<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>Salt (for pasta water)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, following the package instructions. Before draining, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water, as it will help create the sauce later. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
			<li>While the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced guanciale (and garlic cloves, if using) and cook until crispy and golden, which should take about 5-7 minutes. If you used garlic, remove the cloves once they’ve infused their flavor. Turn off the heat and set the skillet aside.</li>
			<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. This mixture will form the creamy base of the carbonara sauce.</li>
			<li>Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the cooked guanciale. Toss the pasta to coat it evenly in the rendered fat. Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture. Stir vigorously to combine, allowing the residual heat to cook the eggs gently and create a smooth, creamy sauce. If the sauce feels too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water, a little at a time, until you reach the desired consistency.</li>
			<li>Plate the carbonara immediately, topping each serving with an extra sprinkle of grated Pecorino Romano and a touch of freshly ground black pepper. Enjoy it while it’s hot for the best flavor and texture!</li>
